Homework3: Principal Component Analysis and Autoencoders

Useful numpy functions
----------------------
In this assignment, you may want to use following helper functions:
- np.linalg.svd(): compute the singular value decomposition on a given matrix. 
- np.dot(): matrices multiplication operation.
- np.mean(): compute the mean value on a given matrix.
- np.zeros(): generate a all '0' matrix with a certain shape.
- np.expand_dims: expand the dimension of an array at the referred axis.
- np.squeeze: Remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. 
- np.transpose(): matrix transpose operation.
- np.linalg.norm(): compute the norm value of a matrix. You may use it for the reconstruct_error function.

    2. Do not do centering. Even though X in the note is the centered data, the neural network is 
    capable to learn this centering process. So unlike PCA, we don't center X for autoencoders,
    and we will still get the same results.
    3. Don't change or slightly change hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of
    epochs for 5(e), 5(f) and 5(g). But for 5(h), you can try more hyperparameters and achieve as good results
    as you can.
